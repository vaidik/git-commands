# Git Commands

A few useful Git Commands

## Usage

### For most systems

1. Put the above files in the `git-core` directory.
2. Make sure they are executable.

### Multiple git installations (for example on Mac)

Sometimes you may have Git installed at multiple places in your system. In that
case, do the following:

1. Clone this repository
2. Give all the files executable permissions.
3. Add the directory to your path.

**Warning:** the issue with this approach is that Git's autocomplete won't
work at all. In that case, I just create new aliases in my global
`.gitconfig` to execute these files.
